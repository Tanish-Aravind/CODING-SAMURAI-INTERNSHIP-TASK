This README documents the key tasks completed during my internship at Coding Samurai. Each task is briefly explained, including the objective, approach, and the main Python libraries and tools used.

3. Linear Regression for House Price Prediction
Objective:
Predict house prices using linear regression on real estate data.

What I Did:

Loaded and explored real estate datasets (e.g., Seattle housing).

Preprocessed data, handled missing values, and selected relevant features.

Built and trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn.

Evaluated the model using metrics like mean squared error and R² score.

Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy — Data handling

scikit-learn — Linear regression modeling and evaluation

matplotlib — Data visualization
