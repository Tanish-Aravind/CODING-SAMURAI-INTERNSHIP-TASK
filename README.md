# CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK
Completed machine learning internship tasks (Batch A-45) from Coding Samurai – includes regression, classification, NLP, and deep learning projects.

🏠 Project 1: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Description:
This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as area, location, number of rooms, presence of air conditioning, guest rooms, etc. It’s a classic regression problem ideal for learning how to handle real estate data and apply core ML concepts.

🛠 Skills Applied:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (yes/no → binary, categorical → OneHotEncoding)

Feature Engineering using ColumnTransformer

Log transformation to normalize skewed target variable

Model Training with LinearRegression

Performance Evaluation using MSE & R² Score

⚙️ Tools & Libraries:
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, LinearRegression, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler

📈 Results:

MSE: ~1.72 trillion

R² Score: 0.658, meaning the model explains around 65.8% of the variance in housing prices – not bad for a basic regression setup!

🧠 Concepts Covered:

Linear Regression

Log transformation for improving prediction accuracy

Model evaluation on original price scale
